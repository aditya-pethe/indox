Now you will generate markdown documentation for the codebase.

Now you will return a directory of markdown files where the documentation will be. Please format your output documentation as a dictionary of markdown files. This dictionary should take the following form

Key: file path to markdown file name, where the root of the file path is a "docs" directory
Value: Markdown content.

You will decide how the directory is structured, and the content of markdown files. Please focus on clarity and readability for developers.
