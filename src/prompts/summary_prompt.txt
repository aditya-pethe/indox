Please briefly summarize the following code file. Include:

1. What it is and what it does, 
2. A list of filepaths from the "file_dir" codebase that this file imports

Format output as a json with the following:

{
    "description": "summary of the code file",
    "imports":[path1,path2]
}

The imports list should have no newlines in them. The paths listed should also ONLY files that are in the "file_dir" list. 
Do not include external packages, etc in the imports list
